# Restaurant Order Analysis

## Overview  
This project looks at restaurant sales and menu data to find out which items are most popular, pricing trends, and customer ordering patterns. Using SQL, I combined and cleaned the data to help improve the menu and make better business decisions. The goal was to use data to make the restaurant more efficient and customer-friendly.

## Data Used  
- **menu_items**: Contains information about each dish (name, price, category)  
- **order_details**: Contains details of each order (items, order date, order ID)

## Tools  
- MySQL (used for data cleaning and analysis)

## What Was Done  
- Counted total items on the menu  
- Found the cheapest and most expensive dishes  
- Checked the number of dishes per cuisine  
- Identified most and least ordered items  
- Analyzed large orders and top spending customers  
- Combined both datasets for deeper insights

## Key Findings  
- **Most expensive item**: Shrimp Scampi (Italian)  
- **Least expensive item**: Edamame (Asian)  
- **Most ordered item**: American Hamburger  
- **Least ordered item**: Chicken Tacos (Mexican)  
- **Top spending order**: Order ID 440
